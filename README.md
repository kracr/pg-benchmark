PGBench documentation
PGBench is a Property Graph Benchmark that takes an RDF graph as input and converts it to a property graph. Further, it runs queries on two well known Graphstores: Neo4j and Redis.

Goal
Benchmarks play an important role in the development of any new systems. Even though there exist several RDF benchmarks but none exist for property graphs. This makes evaluation of property graphstores difficult. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we developed PGBench.


Usage



Future work

The next stage of the work will aim at:
1. Making the benchmark efficient.
2. Covering other graphstores for benchmark evaluation.
